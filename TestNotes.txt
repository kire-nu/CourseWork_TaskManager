ProjectManagerTests>ValidateIdTest
	Using this test method to see if if wildcards would work.
	The result shows that using * as a wildcard does not work.
	This is consistent with the information found through Google.
	If I wanted to use wildcards, I would have to write the 
	lamba expresion with a regex expresion.
TaskManagerTests>UnlinkTaskTest	
	This test fails when either project or person is not defined.
	In the program, no link can be created if project and person exist.
	However, bugs may exist or changes to the code might be made
	such that the method is called anyway.
	The fix would be to introduce some checks to so it from failing.
TaskManagerTests>GetLinkedTasksTest
	Running this test with no project or person defined.
	However, compared to the previous tests, this method has checks
	for result being null and thus the method works.
